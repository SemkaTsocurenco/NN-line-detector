# Post-processing Configuration
# Detection filtering and geometry mapping parameters

# Detection filtering
filtering:
  confidence_threshold: 0.71  # Minimum confidence to keep detection (0.0-1.0)
  min_area: 150.0  # Minimum area in pixels
  merge_iou_threshold: 0.5  # IoU threshold for merging overlapping detections (0.0-1.0)

# Geometry mapping
geometry:
  # Normalization parameters for converting image coords to protocol coords
  normalization_scale: 100  # Scale factor for converting to decimeters

  # Bbox calculation
  bbox_area_offset: 1  # Offset added to bbox dimensions (pixels)

  # Quality calculation
  quality_multiplier: 20  # Multiplier for quality score calculation
  max_quality: 255  # Maximum quality value

  # Confidence conversion
  confidence_to_byte_scale: 255  # Scale factor for converting confidence to byte

# Lane classification
# Map class IDs to line colors
line_colors:
  yellow_classes: [5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15]  # Classes with yellow color
  red_classes: [6]  # Classes with red color
  # Others default to white

# Map class IDs to line styles
line_styles:
  solid_classes: [4, 5, 6]  # Solid single lines
  double_classes: [7, 8]  # Double lines
  dashed_classes: [9, 10]  # Dashed lines
